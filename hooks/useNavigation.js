// hooks/useNavigation.js removed - was invalid (called React.useState inside a plain global function)
// Navigation is handled locally inside react-app.js. This file intentionally left as a no-op placeholder.

// If you want a proper custom hook, convert this file to an ES module that exports:
// export function useNavigation(total) { const [current, setCurrent] = React.useState(0); ... }
